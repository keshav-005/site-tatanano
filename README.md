# site-tatanano
just a general site related to tata Nano

Project idea In brief -
Our mission is to tell the story of ‘THE TATA NANO’ the way it deserves to be told - with facts, 
and the right comparisons. This isn't about selling a car; it’s about restoring the dignity of a 
concept that dared to challenge convention. Designed to break barriers, not just price tags, 
the Nano was a triumph of Indian engineering - a car made for the people, by the people.
 It’s a thank you, a wake-up call, and a reminder that sometimes, greatness wears humble 
wheels.
